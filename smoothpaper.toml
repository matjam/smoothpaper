#               bars on the side if the wallpaper has a less wide aspect ratio. On other
#               displays this might mean cropping the sides if the wallpaper has a wider
#               aspect ratio than the screen.
#
# "horizontal": scales the image to fit horizintally; on widescreens this might result in
#               cropping the top and bottom of the image. On a 4:3 or 16:9 screen this might
#               result in bars on the top and bottom if the aspect ratio of the wallpaper
#               is wider than your screen.
#
#  "stretched": will stretch the image in both directions to fit your screen. This means
#               that if the image does not match your screen's aspect ratio, it will be
#               distorted.
