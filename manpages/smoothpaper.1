.SH NAME
smoothpaper - A hardware accelerated wallpaper changer


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsmoothpaper [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
smoothpaper is a hardware-accelerated wallpaper daemon for X11 window managers.

.EX
It provides smooth, GPU-powered transitions between wallpapers using OpenGL, and is
intended for use as a long-running background process. You can launch it in daemon mode
using the -b or --background flag.

Once running, smoothpaper exposes a local UNIX domain socket API for control. You can
send commands such as:

  • status — check if the daemon is running and inspect the current wallpaper
  • next   — immediately transition to the next wallpaper
  • stop   — gracefully shut down the background daemon
  • load   — load a new list of wallpaper file paths

Wallpapers are shuffled by default (unless configured otherwise), and transitions can
be customized via the configuration file.

The default configuration file is located at:

  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/smoothpaper/smoothpaper.toml

Logs are written to:

  $HOME/.local/share/smoothpaper/smoothpaper.log

and are automatically rotated to prevent log growth over time.

You can generate man pages and shell completion scripts for smoothpaper using the built-in
\&'genman' and 'completion' subcommands. See their help output for usage.

smoothpaper is designed to be lightweight, fast, and aesthetically pleasing for users
who want animated wallpaper transitions without compromising system performance.
